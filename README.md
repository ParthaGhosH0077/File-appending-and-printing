Introduction
This simple Node.js server listens for POST requests, appends the request body to a text file (data.txt), and prints the updated file contents to the console. It handles synchronous file operations and is useful for scenarios like logging or data persistence.

index.js: Implements the server logic for handling POST requests.
server.js: Starts the server and listens on port 3000.
Requirements
Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd your-project-folder
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Send a POST request with the following data using tools like Postman or cURL:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken."
}
Example cURL command:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000 -d '{"message": "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken."}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
After sending the request, the message will be appended to data.txt and the updated file content will be printed in the console.

How It Works
The server listens on port 3000 and handles POST requests.
When a POST request is received, the request body is collected, and the data is synchronously appended to data.txt.
The updated content of data.txt is read and printed to the console.
For any other HTTP methods (e.g., GET), the server will respond with a message instructing to send a POST request.
